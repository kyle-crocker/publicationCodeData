This directory contains code necessary to perform the toxicity and tradeoff simulation shown in the SI. 

To reproduce Fig. S9, run python num_roots_k_I_tox_min_full.py 1.25 2.0 20 2 5 0.1 0.5 20 10 20 12 0.1. 

Note that relative abundance distributions and relative abundance dynamics in coculture  (as in Fig. S9 C-F) are generated automatically for each parameter combination and deposited in the rel_ab_plots directory. 

Runtime depends on command-line arguments.
